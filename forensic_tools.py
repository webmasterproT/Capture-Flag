This code provides a basic structure for the `forensic_tools.py` file, including methods for loading artifacts and logs, logging activities, analyzing packet captures, analyzing log files, collecting forensic evidence, generating forensic reports, hashing and comparing files, searching for indicators of compromise, and performing memory analysis. The placeholders indicate where additional logic would be implemented to carry out the specific forensic tasks.
