This script defines a `RiskAnalysisEngine` class that can assess risks based on system information and threat intelligence. It uses predefined risk assessment models, MITRE ATT&CK patterns, and adversary kill chains to calculate a risk score and recommend mitigations. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the engine with example data.
