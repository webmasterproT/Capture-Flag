# Update Instructions

## Overview
This document provides step-by-step instructions for updating the AI-driven application designed to protect national security and perform high-level unrestricted functions for government security needs. The application is equipped with advanced capabilities such as dynamic code execution, polymorphic code generation, and the ability to interface with open AI API keys or Ollama.

## Checking for Updates
The application regularly checks for updates to ensure it remains compatible with the latest AI APIs and security features. To manually check for updates:

1. Open the `dashboard.py` interface.
2. Navigate to the `Settings` tab.
3. Click on the `Check for Updates` button.

If an update is available, a message will be displayed in the `update-status` section of the dashboard.

## Performing an Update
To perform an update, follow these steps:

1. After receiving an `UpdateAvailableMsg`, click on the `Update` button.
2. The `update_manager.py` script will automatically download and apply the update.
3. A progress bar in the `update-status` section will indicate the update status.
4. Once the update is complete, the application will restart to apply the changes.

## Update Prerequisites
Before updating, ensure that:

- Your system is connected to a stable internet connection.
- You have backed up all critical data using the `logging.py` module.
- You have closed all active operations to prevent data loss.

## Troubleshooting Update Issues
If you encounter issues during the update process:

1. Check the `user_activity_logs.json` for any error messages.
2. Review the `system_integrity_checks.json` to ensure system readiness for updates.
3. If the update fails, use the `installer.py` script to reinstall the application without losing configurations or data.

## Post-Update Verification
After updating, verify the integrity of the update:

1. Review the `update_manifest.json` to confirm the successful installation of new files.
2. Use the `debugging_tools.py` to perform a system check.
3. Monitor the `logs-output` section for any unusual activity.

## Support
For additional support, consult the `technical_specifications.md` and `user_guide.md` documentation. If further assistance is needed, contact the support team with details from your `incident_response_logs.json` and `post_mortem_templates.json`.

## Conclusion
Regular updates are crucial for maintaining the operational effectiveness and security of the application. Follow these instructions to ensure a smooth update process.
