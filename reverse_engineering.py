This code provides a basic structure for reverse engineering binary files, including analyzing and decompiling them. It assumes the presence of certain tools like `strings`, `objdump`, `ltrace`, `strace`, and `ghidra_headless` for decompilation. The `utils.helpers` and `utils.constants` modules are expected to contain helper functions and constants used across the application. The `REVERSE_ENGINEERING_SAMPLES` constant is a JSON file containing paths to various binary samples that can be analyzed.
